Raghavendra Rao with his father Allu Aravind producing, along with C. Ashwini Dutt.[29] Praising his acting performance, Jeevi of Idlebrain criticised his looks in the film and added that "Arjun should choose roles that amplify his strength and nullify his weaknesses."[30] He then appeared in Sukumar's Arya.[31] He plays the eponymous lead, an outgoing and free-spirited boy falling in love with Geetha (Anu Mehta), an introverted girl who is on the shield of another person Ajay (Siva Balaji).[32] The film proved to be his breakthrough, earning a first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and won the Nandi Special Jury Award and the CineMAA Award for Best Actor (Critics).[33] The film was a critical and commercial success,[34] grossing over ₹30 crore,[35] with a production budget of ₹4 crore.[36] In 2006, the film was dubbed and released in Malayalam in Kerala. Owing to the film's success, he received major acclaim across the region and the Malayali people.[37]

        He next starred in V. V. Vinayak's Bunny playing the eponymous lead, a college student.[38] Being successful at the box office, critics praised his efforts, mannerisms and dancing.[39][40] His next film was A. Karunakaran's musical love story Happy.[41][42] The film did well at the box-office especially in the overseas markets.[43] A critic appreciated his dancing skills and performance, but felt that his character is a typical happy-go-lucky guy.[44]</P>
    <H1>FURTHER SUCCESS</H1>
    <P id="FURTHER SUCCESS">He next appeared in V. V. Vinayak's action film Badrinath (2011), in which he played the role of Badri, a modern-day Indian samurai who is assigned to protect the Badrinath Temple by his Guru (Prakash Raj), to whom he is very loyal.[63] Allu Arjun undertook intensive martial arts and sword fighting training in Vietnam[64][65] and marks his first pairing with Tamannaah.[66] It his second A-rated film in India after Vedam (2010), on the account of graphic action violence.[67] The film completed a 50-day run in 187 cinemas.[68] His performance and character received mixed reviews.[69][70] A critic of The Times of India wrote that "Arjun hardly has any scope to emote as he was mostly pushed into action scenes and song sequences."[71]

        After Badrinath, he signed Trivikram Srinivas's action comedy film Julayi in 2011.[72] It was released in 2012, in which he played the role of Ravindra Narayan, a street-smart yet spoilt brat whose life takes a drastic turn after he becomes the witness of a huge bank robbery. A critic wrote that "Allu Arjun puts in a confident performance as the loveable rogue. It's a role that is right up his alley and he carries it off with a characteristic panache. He lights up the screen with his dancing in particular, pulling off some pretty challenging dance moves."[73] Riya Chakravarty of NDTV, in her review, stated that "Arjun has delivered an outstanding performance."[74] He was nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu, for his performance in the film.

        The next year, he starred in Puri Jagannadh's action thriller Iddarammayilatho, playing Sanju Reddy, a guitarist with a dark past, alongside Amala Paul and Catherine Tresa. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu praised his performance in the action sequences and dance moves in various songs in the film, adding "Allu Arjun uses his agility to his advantage in dances and stunt episodes".[75] Another critic wrote that "True to his tag of "stylish star", Allu Arjun looks trendier than ever before. His character of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the fight scenes."[76][77] The film marks his second and last collaboration, with Puri Jagannadh after Desamuduru (2007).</P>

He embraces his deglamorized look and delivers a memorable performance."[128] The Times of India critic Neeshita Nyayapati stated: "Pushpa: The Rise is Allu Arjun's show all the way. He shines in playing this rustic character that is hard on the surface but vulnerable in ways that others don't see."[129] The film proved to be a major commercial success, grossing over ₹350 crore and emerged as the highest grossing Indian film in 2021.[130] He won his fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu alongside National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance, of which the latter became a first for a Telugu film actor.[131][132][133] Allu Arjun's performance along with one of the dialogues from the film, "Thaggede Le" achieved the cult status and made a huge impact in the Indian pop culture scene.[134][135] A sequel titled Pushpa 2: The Rule [136] was released on 5 December 2024.[137]The film proved to be a massive success at the box office, breaking several records.
